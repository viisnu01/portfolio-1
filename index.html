      The system dynamically classifies modulation types — <strong>BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM</strong> — using real-time <strong>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)</strong> and <strong>Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)</strong> metrics.  
      A custom <strong>GNU Radio algorithm</strong> with an embedded Python block enables on-the-fly waveform analysis and classification without requiring hardware-level reconfiguration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep learning model combines <strong>CNN</strong> layers for feature extraction and <strong>LSTM</strong> networks for temporal sequence prediction, achieving a classification accuracy of <strong>95.4%</strong> across 55 modulation schemes.  
      Training data was generated using <strong>MATLAB’s Communication Toolbox</strong> for 1,10,000 waveform samples under various SNR and Eb/N₀ conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model was deployed using the <strong>ONNX framework</strong> to ensure cross-platform compatibility and integrated with <strong>SDR hardware</strong> (HackRF, USRP, Xilinx RFSoC PYNQ) for real-time testing.  
      Evaluation metrics such as <strong>Bit Error Rate (BER)</strong> and throughput confirmed the system’s robustness under varying channel conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tech Stack Used:</strong> GNU Radio, HackRF/USRP/Xilinx RFSoC PYNQ, MATLAB, Python, TensorFlow, ONNX, CNN-LSTM Architecture, DVB-S2X Signal Dataset.
